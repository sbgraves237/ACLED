# ACLED

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This "ACLED" package contains vignettes, functions and data to help merge ACLED with other, e.g., World Bank, data and analyze. 

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
